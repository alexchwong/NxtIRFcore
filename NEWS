Changes in version 1.1.1 (2022-01-11)
+ Bugfix for NxtSE constructor.
+ Bugfix for Consistency filter: previously an "average" filter was used, such
  that upstream / downstream filter triggers counted for 0.5, whereas it added
  1.0 if both up/downstream filters were triggered. From 1.1.1 onwards, 1.0 is
  added when either upstream or downstream consistency filter is triggered.
+ Added two new annotation-based filters: Terminus and ExclusiveMXE. See
  ?NxtFilter for details
+ Annotated retained introns `RI` are defined by any intron that is completely
  overlapped by a single exon of any transcript.
  They are calculated as binary events, i.e. as PSI between RI and specific
  spliced intron, and do not consider overlapping splice events 
  (unlike `IR` events, which are calculated for all other constitutive introns)
